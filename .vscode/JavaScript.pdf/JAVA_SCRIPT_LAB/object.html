<h2>JavaScript Objects</h2>
<p>JavaScript objects are mutable.</p>
<p>Any changes to a copy of an object will also change the original object:</p>
<script>
const person = {
firstName: "John",
lastName: "Doe",
age:50,
eyeColor: "blue"
};
document.write(person.firstName + " is " + person.age + " years old.");
const x = person;
x.age = 10;
document.write(person.firstName + " is " + person.age + " years old.");
</script>
